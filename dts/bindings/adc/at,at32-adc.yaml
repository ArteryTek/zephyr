  at,adc-clock-source:
    type: string
    required: true
    enum:
      - "SYNC"
      - "ASYNC"
    description: |
      Type of ADC clock source :
      - "SYNC": derived from the bus clock.
      - "ASYNC" : independent and asynchronous with the bus clock
      One of the two values may not apply to some series. Refer to the RefMan.
      If an asynchronous clock is selected, a domain clock in the clock property
      has to be defined explicitly.

      Clock prescaler at the input of the ADC:
      Apply to synchronous or asynchronous clock depending on the AT32
      at,adc-clock-source.

  vref-mv:
    type: int
    default: 3300
    description: Indicates the reference voltage of the ADC in mV (on the target board).

  resolutions:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      List of the resolutions supported by the ADC instance. They should be
      values created with AT32 macro or similar. Their order is not
      important. For example for AT32F45X:
      <12> <10> <8> <6>)
      The two parameters are the resolution (for example 10 bits) and the
      corresponding register value (0x01 for a 10-bit resolution).
      By design, these macros also contains all register information (address,
      field offset and field mask) necessary to properly set the resolution.

  sampling-times:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      List all the sampling times supported by the ADC instance.
      Rounded up if needed. Order is important: their index matches their binary
      value in the register.

  num-sampling-time-common-channels:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of sampling time common channels for this ADC instance, if any.

  at,adc-sequencer:
    type: string
    required: true
    enum:
      - "NOT_FULLY_CONFIGURABLE"
      - "FULLY_CONFIGURABLE"
    description: |
      Type of ADC sequencer:
      - "NOT_FULLY_CONFIGURABLE": Not fully configurable sequencer
      - "FULLY_CONFIGURABLE": Fully configurable sequencer

    enum:
      - "OVERSAMPLER_NONE"
      - "OVERSAMPLER_MINIMAL"
      - "OVERSAMPLER_EXTENDED"
    description: |
      Type of ADC oversampler:
      - "OVERSAMPLER_NONE": No oversampler
      - "OVERSAMPLER_MINIMAL": Oversampler with 8 possible oversampling values (2, 4, 8, ..., 256)
      - "OVERSAMPLER_EXTENDED": Oversampler with 1024 possible oversampling values (1..1024)
